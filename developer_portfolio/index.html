          Hi, I am <strong> Md.Mooontaser Alam</strong>, studying at a
          <b> united international university</b> in Bangladesh. I completed my
          bachelor's degree in dept of computer science and engineering. I am
          currently doing my thesis, which topic is Biomedical image
          segmentation based on deep learning and Advanced machine learning. I
          am always interested in becoming a good programmer because I want to
          be a software developer in a renowned company in Bangladesh or any
          other country. Currently, I am spending my whole time developing my
          skill and trying to manage an internship to prepare myself as a good
          developer.
